#Stock Data Analysis with PySpark and AWS Glue
#Overview
This project involves processing stock data using PySpark within AWS Glue. The script performs several key tasks, including handling missing data, calculating metrics, and saving results to Amazon S3. Additionally, it creates external tables in Amazon Athena for querying the processed data.

#Requirements
AWS Glue
Apache Spark
AWS S3
AWS Athena
boto3
PySpark
Python 3.x
Setup
#AWS Credentials: Ensure that your AWS credentials are configured properly. You can set them up in ~/.aws/credentials or through environment variables.

#Dependencies: Install required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install boto3 pyspark
Configuration
#Before running the script, make sure to update the following parameters:

INPUT_PATH: The S3 path where the input CSV file is located.
OUTPUT_PATH: The S3 path where the output data will be saved.
Running the Script
#You can run the script using the following command:

bash
Copy code
spark-submit Shoshans_data_engineering_assignment.py --INPUT_PATH s3://your-bucket/input/your-file.csv --OUTPUT_PATH s3://your-bucket/output/
Script Details
Functions
save_to_s3(df, path): Saves a DataFrame to the specified S3 path.
check_s3_path_exists(path): Checks if the specified S3 path exists.
create_athena_table(database, table_name, s3_path): Creates an external table in Athena pointing to the given S3 path.
Main Tasks
#Data Loading and Cleaning:

Loads stock data from an S3 bucket.
Handles missing close and volume values.
#Metrics Calculation:

Calculates daily return and saves the average return to S3.
Determines the highest worth stock and saves the result to S3.
Computes stock volatility and saves the result to S3.
Calculates the top 30-day returns and saves the results to S3.
#Athena Table Creation:

Creates external tables in Athena for the processed data.
Logs
The script logs its operations and errors using Pythonâ€™s logging module. Logs will be printed to the standard output.

#Troubleshooting
Ensure that AWS credentials are correctly configured and have the necessary permissions.
Verify that the S3 paths provided are correct and accessible.
Check the AWS Glue and Athena documentation for any additional configuration or troubleshooting.
